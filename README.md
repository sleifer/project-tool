# project-tool

A tool with a collection of helpers I wrote to aid in working with Xcode projects.

* build -- Build project in various ways.
* cleanup -- Delete build products.
* docs -- Use jazzy to generate documentation for project.
* project -- Act on project (directory) in various ways.
* readme -- View (or edit) README.html, README.pdf, README.md.
* runscript -- Helper to add common Run Script build phases to Xcode projects.
* schemes -- List project schemes.
* stamp -- Embed git SHA in build.
* targets -- List project targets.
* version -- AGV helpers.
* xcframework -- Build an xcframework from current project.

Publishing in 2021 so I can share a few tools.
